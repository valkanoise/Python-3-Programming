Part B: WOFHumanPlayer

Next, we’re going to define a class named WOFHumanPlayer, which should inherit from WOFPlayer (part A). This class is going to represent a human player. In addition to having all of the instance variables and methods that WOFPlayer has, WOFHumanPlayer should have an additional method:

.getMove(category, obscuredPhrase, guessed): Should ask the user to enter a move (using input()) and return whatever string they entered.

.getMove()’s prompt should be:

{name} has ${prizeMoney}

Category: {category}
Phrase:  {obscured_phrase}
Guessed: {guessed}

Guess a letter, phrase, or type 'exit' or 'pass':
For example:

Steve has $200

Category: Places
Phrase: _L___ER N____N_L P_RK
Guessed: B, E, K, L, N, P, R, X, Z

Guess a letter, phrase, or type 'exit' or 'pass':
The user can then enter:

'exit' to exit the game

'pass' to skip their turn

a single character to guess that letter

a complete phrase (a multi-character phrase other than 'exit' or 'pass') to guess that phrase

Note that .getMove() does not need to enforce anything about the user’s input; that will be done via the game logic that we define in the next ActiveCode window.
