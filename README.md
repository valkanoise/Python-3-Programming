# Python-3-Programming

Link: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming?#courses

In here I provide all the material I used for this course. It is a little bit more advanced than [Python 4 Everyone](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) or the free [Python 4 Everyone](https://www.py4e.com/) version.
With this course you will get deeper into the main concepts of Python and will help you feel more confident with your skills.
